Technical Summary
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction/LitReview (What is the problem?)}
 
\begin{itemize}
   \item[-] Overview of AlphaZero Algorithm (basically the methods section of the AZ paper)
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[-] Program overview/structure (flowchart?)
   \item[-] OpenAI implementation? This was difficult for me to do but there's not much I can say other than just showing the code
   \item[-] Explain 2D state used
   \item[-] Explain return function used
   \item[-] Explain adversary used
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[-] Graphs of statistics for each policy iteration, eg, errors over time for each nnet
   \item[-] Performance against random and a greedy algorithm (make the moves that move x pos closer to 0)
   \item[-] Graphs of steps taken vs expected steps left
   \item[-] Graphs of return vs time
   \item[-] If I have time, ill compare different adversaries: vs greedy, vs itself with 1/2 power etc
\end{itemize}  

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[-] Explain the graphs above
   \item[-] Talk about problems?
   \item[-] Which adversary was the best
   \item[-] Which method learnt the quickest
   \item[-] Talk about which representation of 2D state is the best? I havent done any of the others...
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Plan}

I'm less sure of what to write for this section? Is it just a timeline/gantt chart with a plan and then some text explaining what each part of the plan is?

\begin{itemize}
   \item[-] Expansion to other problems
   \item[-] Timeline moving forward
   \item[-] Improvement of Nnet? Improvement of binning?
\end{itemize}
